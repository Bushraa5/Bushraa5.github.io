At the start we got cards to be able to open the doors and Cahal introduced the programme to us and told us what we will be doing today. Then we did an office tour to see the place, it's very fancy and cool looking. I really liked it, my favourite place is the canteen because there's a lot of snacks. We got to go to our desks and log in to see if everything is working and play around with the laptops. We had lunch then a workshop on Agile. I didn't know what it meant or what it is but the workshop was very interesting and I liked it, it really made me think of my purpose and the meaning of agility/agile. We did a bit on the history of agile, true or false and at the end we were split into two teams, the villains and the heros. We made potato heads, a villain and a hero in teams to see what we did well and how we worked together in a team to build the potato head. We finished early today so it was a short and nice day.
